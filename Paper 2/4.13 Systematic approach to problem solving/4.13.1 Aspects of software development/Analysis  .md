# Analysis
The first stage of system development where the problem is identified, researched and alternative solutions proposed.
```
This is where the problem must be identified and fully analyse the nature of the problem 
and the requirements of the system to solve it, before the problem to be solved.
```

##Defining the problem
Analysis is where you're not actually looking for a possible solutions. It's identifying the scope of a problem
and how much of the problem a new system can solve.

*Interaction with the end users, allow identification of the specific problems that could be created to specificially target them, therefore less likely you are
to do something they do not want*
