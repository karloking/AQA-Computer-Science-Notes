# Network Topology

>**Understand:**
>*  physical star topology
>* logical bus network topology

>**and:**
>* differentiate between them
>* explain their operation.

##Bus Topology
**Bus topology:** In this network configuration all of the clients, servers and resources are connected to one cable (the bus). When a device communicates, the message is transmitted down the bus that all devices receive, but only the intended recipient accepts and processes the message

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|:----------:|:--------------|
|It is easy and cheap to install as a consequence of requiring only a small quantity of cable. | The cable length is limited. This restricts the number of devices that can be connected to the network.|
|It is suitable for small networks. | As more devices are connected, the performance of the network becomes slower as a consequence of data collisions.|
| Easy to add new clients by branching them off the main cable|	All workstations see all data â€“ so there is a security risk. |

##Star Topology
**Star Topology:** A way of connecting devise in a network where each workstation has a dedicated cable to a central computer or switch.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|:----------:|:--------------|
|	They are reliable as if one cable or device fails then the other devices will be unaffected | 	Expensive to install as lots of cabling is required and extra hardware (the central device) |
|	They are high performing as no data collision occur since each client has a dedicated cable. | If the central device so will the whole network|
|	Changes to one client do not affect the others. | The server can get congested as all communications must pass through it |
