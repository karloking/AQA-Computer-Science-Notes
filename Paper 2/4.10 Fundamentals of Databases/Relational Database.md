# Relational Database

Relational databases consist of more than one table that are linked using key fields. A relational database has three main components; a store, a method of creating and retrieving data, and a method of ensuring that the data is logically consistent.

Possible situations when a text file would be a better choice than a relational database:
*	When the data can be edited by users
*	When the data to be stored does not need the overhead of a relational database.
*	Could save memory space if data is not large.

## Features of a Database
|  | Description |
| :-------: | :---------- |
| Field |It is the smallest piece of information that can be retrieved from a database and it is at the intersection of a row and a column in a database table.|
| Foreign Key | The foreign key is a column identified to establish a connection between the data in two tables. In the context of relational databases, a foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table |
| Index | used to speed up searches |
| Primary Key |uniquely identifies a row of data |
| Record | a row of data within a table |
| Relationship |  links between tables |
|	Column | A column within a table contains all the information of a single type. |
| Search Criteria | In databases you use search criteria to find records, using logical operators if there is more than one part to the criteria. |
